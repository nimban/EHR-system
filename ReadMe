OVERVIEW

This is an application for managing Hospital records including Patient Details,
Employee information (for doctors and nurses), and billing/admission records
including information about patient diagnosis, medications, procedures etc
and the associated billing records.

Some of the pages in the webapp include:
- Admissions/Billing
        This is a consolidated view of all patients records mapped to the diagnosis of
        their condition, the doctor seeing, procedures performed, medications prescribed and
        the associated bill for each of these. It also allows admins or doctors to filter
        records based on patient or condition/meds etc which can be used to analyse how often
        different conditions occur etc.
- Patient Records
        This page is used by administrators to manage patient records. All patient records are
        retrieved by default which can then be filtered based on any of the values/attributes.
        It also allows adding/deleting of patient records.
